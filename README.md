☑ Move focused window to virtual desktop ([⇧ Shift] + [⊞ Win], then [⇧ Shift] + [2]) <br>

☑ Allows window maximization <br>
☑ Toggle tiling on/off ([⇧ Shift] + [⊞ Win], then [F11]) <br>

☑ Windows open in focused panel <br>
☑ Remap activation hotkey to [⇧ Shift] + [⊞ Win], [Ctrl] + [⊞ Win] or [Alt] + [⊞ Win] <br>

FancyWM uses [⇧ Shift] + [⊞ Win] as the start of a command sequence (Activation hotkey). To start a command sequence, press and release these keys simultaneously, then follow up by pressing one of the keybindings you have configured in the settings.

FancyWM only manages restored (not minimized, not maximized) top-level application windows, so it doesn't interfere with popups, and still allows you to use all of your available display area for when you need to focus on a window.
